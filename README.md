We made credit risk prediction on the data set taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kabure/german-credit-data-with-risk).

## Dataset Information

The original dataset contains 1000 entries with 20 categorial/symbolic attributes prepared by Prof. Hofmann. In this dataset, each entry represents a person who takes a credit by a bank. Each person is classified as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes. The link to the original dataset can be found below.
